# RCLootCouncil - Extra Utilities

Official module adding extra utilities for [RCLootCouncil](http://www.curse.com/addons/wow/rclootcouncil).
Everything I deem unnecessary for the core addon (most likely everything from now on) might go here instead.

The latest release is available at [Curse](https://mods.curse.com/addons/wow/257427-rclootcouncil-extrautilities).
